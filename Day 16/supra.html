<b>In 1997, for the 1998 model year, updates were a 3-spoke steering wheel, a redesigned radio, and VVT-i on the naturally aspirated engine. In Japan, the turbo engines were installed with VVT-i. The SZ-R model was also updated with the introduction of a six-speed Getrag V161 transmission, the same one used for the twin-turbo RZ models. The RZ-S received a tiptronic gearbox with steering wheel mounted gear controls. The RZ and SZ-R were both factory-fitted with Toyotas REAS suspension and carbon-fibre steering wheel to aid in the light feeling of steering. The RZ only came with a six-speed manual gearbox that was also used on the SZ-R and was factory fitted with Recaro SR2 front seats. The RZ model series of this time would end up being one of the rarest halo cars of the Japanese manufacturers, with about 653 units being produced for the 1998 model year up until the end of production in 2002, being outsold by the Nissan Skyline GTR, Mazda RX7 and the Honda/Acura NSX.</b>

<b>The new engine used in the A70 Supra, the Toyota 7M-GE, was the flagship engine of Toyota's arsenal. Both versions of the engine contained 4 valves per cylinder and dual overhead cams. The turbocharged 7M-GTE engine was Toyota's first distributor-less engine offered in the US which used coil packs sitting on the cam covers and a cam position sensor driven by the exhaust camshaft.[22] It was equipped with a CT26 turbocharger and was rated at 172 kW (231 hp; 234 PS) at 5,600 rpm while the naturally aspirated 7M-GE engine was rated at 149 kW (200 hp; 203 PS) at 6,000 rpm. Further refinement on the turbo model increased power to 173 kW (232 hp; 235 PS) at 5,600 rpm and 254 lb⋅ft (344 N⋅m) of torque at 3,200 rpm in 1989. This was mostly due to a redesign of the wastegate. All models used the same tyre size of 225/50R16 on 16x7 inch wheels. Spare tyres were full-sized but on steel wheels.

    The naturally aspirated model came standard with the W58 manual transmission. The turbocharged models included the R154 manual transmission. Both were available with the optional 4-speed A340E automatic transmission.
    
    
    The third-generation Supra represented an arsenal of new technology. In 1986, options available for the Supra included a 3-channel ABS and TEMS which gave the driver two settings which affected the damper rates; a third was automatically activated at wide open throttle, hard braking, and high speed maneuvering.</b>

<b>Motor Trend had reported that a possible Supra successor could be based on the FT-HS (Future Toyota-Hybrid Sport),[15] which debuted at the 2007 North American International Auto Show. The publication also reported that the fifth generation of the Supra could be powered by a 3.5-litre V-6 hybrid system generating over 298 kW (400 hp; 405 PS). Toyota quoted that it was not rushing for the Supra successor but instead was waiting to see how the sales and interests of the GT86/FR-S went.[16]

    In 2010, Toyota applied for a trademark for the Supra name. The trademark had to be used within three years for it to be valid.[17] In December 2011, Autoguide reported a possible Supra replacement that would sit above the GT86.[18] Tetsuya Tada, the chief engineer of the Toyota 86/Scion FR-S told reporters in Germany in 2012 "the president (Akio Toyoda) has asked me to make a successor to the Supra as soon as possible."[19]
    
    In late 2013, AutoBlog reported a Supra successor concept would be making its debut the January 2014 North American International Auto Show.[20] On 13 January, Toyota unveiled its new FT-1 concept car. Little is known about this new concept car; other than that it has a front engine and rear wheel drive layout. Toyota also stated that their new concept car draws inspiration from Toyota's past sports cars like the 2000GT, Supra, MR-2 and 2007 FT-HS concept car. Toyota did not state whether the FT-1 would use the Supra name, or if it was even bound for production. However, Toyota did state if the FT-1 is approved from production, a price tag of around US$60,000 was to be expected for each unit.[21] Upon the car's reveal, chief designer—Nobuo Nakamura—confirmed that the FT-1's design was used for inspiration for the Supra but the two cars differ in many ways. The production Supra was smaller and more of a pure sports car design, as opposed to the FT-1 being a larger grand tourer.[22] According to Akio Toyoda, the new Supra's design and performance identity were inspired by the Toyota 2000GT.[23][24] The interior design, layout, and parts (like the materials, seats, and steering wheel) were also done by Toyota, while only small interior switchgear come from BMW.</b>
